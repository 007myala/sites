          <p>Tonight, is a night just like any other, Mama is somewhere in the house, Percy is sitting by your side and Gogo is leaning back in her chair, hands raised as she tells her story…some nights she tells funny stories, leaving you and Percy laughing. Other nights when your little brother’s eyelids are heavy with sleep and he keeps nodding off, she tells the other stories. The stories she says are just for your ears because Percy is too young and you…well you’re a young girl and there are things about this world that Gogo says you should know. </p>
          <p>You look over and see Percy’s eyes wide and bright, his gaze fixed on your grandmother’s face, listening to her every word. Yes tonight, tonight Gogo’s telling a funny story. Something about a woman who lived in a large shoe. You notice that Percy’s hair has grown out again. The golden locks are all the way to his shoulder blades. You remind yourself to cut his hair before Mama notices. </p>
          <p>When Gogo’s story ends, Mama is standing in the doorway. Her lips are pressed shut and her arms are crossed over her chest. She is wearing a nightgown that falls to her ankles, its boxy and bulky shape hides her thin frame. It seems like eternity before she finally speaks, “Ella, Percy…time for bed.”</p>
          <p>Percy says goodnight to Gogo, kissing her cheek and giving her a hug. He then rushes for the door and throws his arms around Mama, who hesitates at first but then hugs him back. You watch as her slender fingers slide through his hair and you rush him out of the room before she can start yelling.</p>
          <p>“Goodnight Mama,” you yell over your shoulder as you run up the staircase. She responds with a “hmmm” and disappears down a dark hallway.</p>

          <p>The next morning when you wake Percy up, you find that his hair has grown down to his waist. He protests as usual when he sees the scissors in your hands, but you go about your normal morning routine reminding him that Mama will be upset if she were to see it. You let him have a few minutes in front of the mirror as you take your time straightening his bed. From the corner of your eye, you watch as he brushes his hair, a sad little smile on his face. You hear a soft sigh and then he has the scissors in his hand, and when he is finished his hair is as short as your little finger and in some places, he's cut so close you can almost see his scalp. </p>
          <p>"Oh Percy," you hug him. "I'm so sorry."</p>
          <p>He doesn't say anything and instead wriggles out of your hug, grabs a towel and heads for the bathroom.</p>

          <p>At breakfast, when Mama sees Percy's hair, she stops her spoon midway to her mouth. She glares at Percy first then at you. Gogo just runs her hand over and over Percy's head and tickles him until a smile returns to his face.</p>

          <p>The messenger from the palace arrives when you and Gogo are clearing up. There is to be a royal ball. All eligible maidens are required to attend, and preparations are to begin the following day, with a selection of maidens. When the messenger leaves, Mama turns to you, as if weighing her options. You are already thinking of ball gowns, lavish castle ballrooms, the prince, fancy food. But then your mind returns and you realised that there is no money for dresses, you don't want to let yourself think of fancy dresses, the ballroom filled with music, but when you look at Mama you can see that she too is thinking of . You know that the messenger would not have come, if you were still not in good standing. Despite the state of the house, and the fact that of all of Papa's cattle, there is only one cow left and she barely gives any milk.</p>
          <p>Mama turns to you and asks, "Do you want to go to the ball?"<p>
          <p>You say "no"</p>
          <p>You say "yes"</p>
